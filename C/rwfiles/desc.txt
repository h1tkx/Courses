Exercice 1: Writing to a Text File (Beginner)

Objective: Create a program that opens a file named info.txt in writing mode.
Write a character, a string, and an integer into it using format specifiers, then close the file properly.

Constraint: You must ensure the file opened successfully before writing.

--

Exercice 2: Reading from a Text File (Intermediate)
Objective: Write a program that opens the info.txt file created in Exercise 1.
Read the character, the string, and the integer back into variables and display them on the console.

Constraint: Use fscanf for formatted reading as demonstrated in the course examples.

--

Exercice 3: Binary File Storage (Advanced)
Objective: Create an array of 5 floating-point numbers.
Write this entire array at once into a binary file named numbers.dat.
Then, verify the operation by clearing the array in memory and reading the data back from the file.

Constraint: Use fwrite and fread with sizeof to handle the binary data in blocks.

--

Exercice 4: Random Access / Direct Access (Expert)
Objective: Using the numbers.dat binary file created in Exercise 3 (containing 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5),
write a program that modifies only the 3rd element (changing 3.3 to 99.9) without rewriting the other numbers.

Constraint: You must use fseek to position the cursor directly at the 3rd element, write the new value,
and then use rewind or fseek to go back to the start to display the updated file content.
